# Kortex
Kortex is a 2D top down strategy game which takes place in the futuristic Universe of Abe.

You play as a military commander who is defending a search beacon from enemy aliens that are trying to destroy it. Your job is to strategically place turrets and walls to quell the barrage of alien life forms swarming the team on the ground who are desperately trying to defend the beacon using guns that arenâ€™t quite powerful enough.

Kortex employs multiple game enhancing systems, such as a technology tree, and a scrap system for building up your capabilities. These systems are further enhanced by the evolution of the music in Kortex, which creates true battle tension for the player.

With familiar game controls (mouse and keyboard as well as full touch screen support), Kortex allows the player to fight a never ending, world based battle with numerous foes, spanning across numerous maps.
